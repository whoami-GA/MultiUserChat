#MultiUserChat
With this multiuser chat programmed in python you can connect with whoever you want in a local network, it is made with the help of the Hack4u site.

We has used; 
Threading library to work with more sockets in the same time.
Socket library to send the data.
Tkinter to have a nice GUI.
ssl library to crypt the chat.

Have a nice day. :)
